# Submit A Profile (Beginner Friendly Instructions)

To add your profile to the list, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```

    Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name of the repository you forked.

3. Navigate to the `README.md` file in the repository. Edit the `README.md` file and add your profile information in the following format:

   ```bash
   
       | First Name | Last Name | GitHub Profile                                          | GitHub Readme                                                         |
       |------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
       | YourFirst  | YourLast  | [YourUsername](https://github.com/YourUsername)         | [README](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourUsername) |
   
   ```

   Replace `YourFirst`, `YourLast`, and `YourUsername` with your first name, last name, and GitHub username, respectively.

4. After adding your profile information, commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Add my profile to the list"
    ```

5. Push your changes to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

6. Create a new pull request by navigating to your forked repository on GitHub and clicking the "New pull request" button. Provide a brief description of the changes you made and submit the pull request.

Once your pull request is approved and merged, your profile will be added to the list of profiles in this repository.
